WinBig Lotto source code README
-------------------------------

This is some of the source code from my WinBig Lotto app, which allows the user to choose 4 or more numbers
and creates a complete set of all combinations of these numbers.  Depending on how many numbers were chosen
by user, the number of combinations may be small (for example 6, 21, 56), medium, or large (10,000 or more).

Below are three things I needed to implement in this app with corresponding file names.

1. Loading and saving user-created data (see AppDelegate.m)

2. Format the raw data that was just generated by the app and is currently stored in C structure in _dgCalc
   object into HTML, and store it in _pageDataArray mutable array (see ModelController.m)

3. Display our formatted HTML page now contained in dataObject to our WebView, or if user wants to email the
   results, output it all to a PDF file which we will then attach to an e-mail (see DataViewController.m)

I also included additional source files for reference.
